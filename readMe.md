# Trivia Project

## tasks

- each pull together three questions in our categories, code that data in replit
- play around with prompts
- play around with how to execute js scripts
- play around with users (and OOP)

## Specs

- choose category
- display if answer is correct or wrong
- score counter
- high score (if there's time)
- make questions random (if there's time)
- validate inputs and throw errors (if there is time)

## strategy

how to store data:
- array of objects. each question is an object.
- array of objects. each object is a category


## data structure (not OOP)

gameData = [
    {
      theme:history,
      questionArray:
      [
        {
          QID: 1,
          question: g,
          answer:hkbkj,
        },
        {
        QID: 2,
        question: quesetion2
        answer: answer2
        }
      ]
    },
    {
    theme: survival,
    
    }
  ]

  gameStatus = [
  answered
  
  ]

  gameRunner(gameData){
  
  }





{question 2: answer2}
],
survival: [
{question1: answer1},
{question 2: answer2}
]
}

## other

ourObj = {
history: [
{question: "the question 1",
answer: "the answer 1"},
{question: "the question 2",
answer: "the answer 2"}
],
survival: [
{question1: answer1},
{question 2: answer2}
]
}


-array of objects
const arrayOfObjects = [
{
theme: movie
question: ""
answer:  ""
}
]


-object of objects
const objectOfObjects {
movies: {
question 1: answer 1
question 2: answer 2
}
}

{
question 1: answer 1
question 2: answer 2
}
const history = [
question 1: answer 1
"q"
"a"
]



]

movies: {
`what is ....., please choose from A ... B ...  C ... D... `: C
question 2: answer 2
}


{
  question: quetion 1,
  answer: answer 1
}

Matt:
create children of children, use OOP, use inheritance, objects with key value pairs, nested by category, tehcnlogy category, key of technology
the game as top most level parent, have methods for keeping track of score and users, the objects that are returned could be name and score, if children  of object  then you can keep track of users and which questions they are on
create one object with questions on it, and create a bunch of functions that will move to

keys as categories, value would be an array of the key value pair, each value would be questions key and then the answer

{

category: {

[]

}

}
